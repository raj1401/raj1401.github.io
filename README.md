- Spearheaded the design and development of *Bluegill*, an autonomic AI platform enabling secure, distributed training of explainable AI models.
- Led a multidisciplinary team, managing two week sprints, conducting code reviews, and collaborating with over 10 research teams, boosting research efficiency by 50%.
- Implemented robust CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and used Agile practices to streamline development, automate testing, and ensure seamless deployment.
- Improved user satisfaction by 30% and improved user experience by providing a privacy-focused LLM-based chatbot integrated into the platform.
- **Tech Stack**: PostgreSQL, Angular, Python, Microsoft Azure

**Undergraduate Research Engineer @ Cancer Systems Lab, IISc (_May 2022 - July 2023_)**
- Directed the development of a high-performance genomic data storage and retrieval system and utilized deep learning to achieve 98% accuracy on Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) prediction.
- Engineered a parallelized framework optimized for high-performance computing systems to train deep learning models on time-series gene interaction data and accurately predict GRNs, significantly enhancing data processing efficiency and scalability.

## Projects & Research
### MS Thesis - Diffusion Models for 3D Reconstruction
Designed and implemented a deep learning framework that utilizes Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) architecture to learn Gaussian ellipsoid representation of 3D scenes. The trained model can be used to generate novel 3D scenes. Devised a multi-view guided sampling strategy to guide sampling from the trained DDPM in order to achieve desirable 3D scenes.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot
Designed an RAG chatbot that runs your LLM of choice locally using Llama-cpp, refines user queries and context using relevant embeddings of documents provided by the user from a vector database.
